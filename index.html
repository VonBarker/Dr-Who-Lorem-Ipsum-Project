            <h2>I had to face my fear…that was more important than just going on living…. I don't like it.</h2>
            <p>I had to face my fear…that was more important than just going on living…. I don't like it. Geronimo! There's always something to look at if you open your eyes! And everybody lives, Rose! Everybody lives! I need more days like this! Go on, ask me anything; I'm on fire! Goodbye, Clara. Alright? Of course I'm alright, my child. You know, I am so constantly outwitting the opposition, I tend to forget the delights and satisfaction of the gentle art of fisticuffs. Well, I'm still not the man I used to be… thank goodness.</p>
            <h2>A straight line may be the shortest distance between two points, but it is by no means the most interesting.</h2>
            <p>A straight line may be the shortest distance between two points, but it is by no means the most interesting. Your hips are fine, you're built like a man! You ain't seen nothing yet! I never know why. I only know who. Great men are forged in fire. It is the privilege of lesser men to light the flame. Whatever the cost. I just have one question… do you know how to fly this thing? Yes, well, it's a brilliant noise. I love that noise. The least important things, sometimes my dear boy, lead to the greatest discoveries.</p>
            <h2>Do try and keep out of my way in future and in past, there's a good fellow.</h2>
            <p>Do try and keep out of my way in future and in past, there's a good fellow. The time continuum should be big enough for the both of us. The least important things, sometimes my dear boy, lead to the greatest discoveries. Great men are forged in fire. It is the privilege of lesser men to light the flame. Whatever the cost. Why can't you leave me alone?! Allow me to congratulate you, sir. You have the most totally closed mind that I've ever encountered. Butterfingers. Allons-y! When I say run, run. …RUN!</p>
            <h2>A TARDIS is my ship that carries me through Time and Space.</h2>
            <p>A TARDIS is my ship that carries me through Time and Space. T-A-R-D-I-S. It stands for Time And Relative Dimension In Space. A little gratitude wouldn't irretrievably damage my ego. Our lives are different from anybody else's. That's the exciting thing. Nobody in the universe can do what we're doing. Let's go in! I am the Doctor! The original you might say! Would you like a jelly baby? Boring. And I hate hotels. It was on the planet Skaro that my old enemy the Master was finally put on trial. They say he listened calmly as his list of evil crimes was read… and sentence passed. Then he made his last and I thought somewhat curious request. He demanded that I, the Doctor, a rival Timelord, should take his remains back to our home planet, Gallifrey.</p>
            <h2>Be a pal and tell me, Am I a good man?</h2>
            <p>Be a pal and tell me, Am I a good man? Oh, my giddy aunt! I don't suppose we'll ever know if we actually succeeded. But at worst, we failed doing the right thing, as opposed to succeeding in doing the wrong. You're a clumsy, ham fisted idiot! Allow me to congratulate you, sir. You have the most totally closed mind that I've ever encountered. We're trying to defeat the Daleks, not start a jumble sale! How can you miss me? I'm easy to find. I'm the guy with two hearts, remember? Your ideas are too narrow and crippled. I am a citizen of the universe and a gentleman to boot.</p>
            <h2>I don't know. But I'd probably blame the English.</h2>
            <p>I don't know. But I'd probably blame the English. Well, it wouldn't be cricket. It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezzes are cool. So these are my replacements. A dandy and a clown. This is a situation that requires tact and finesse. Fortunately, I am blessed with both. People spend all their time making nice things and then other people come along and break them! Jelly baby? The trouble with computers, of course, is that they're very sophisticated idiots. They do exactly what you tell them at amazing speed. Even if you order them to kill you. So if you do happen to change your mind, it's very difficult to stop them from obeying the original order. But not impossible.</p>
            <h2>What? What?! WHAT?!</h2>
            <p>What? What?! WHAT?! You may disguise your features but you can never disguise your intent. There are fixed points throughout time where things must stay exactly the way they are. This is not one of them. This is an opportunity! Whatever happens here will create its own timeline, its own reality, a temporal tipping point. The future revolves around you, here, now, so do good! No, not the hugging. I'm against the hugging. Sorry, must dash! Reverse the polarity of… I hate computers and refuse to be bullied by them.</p>
